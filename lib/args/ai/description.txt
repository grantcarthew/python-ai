Sends requests to ChatGPT using the OpenAI API.
The result is shown in the terminal and copied onto the clipboard.

An OpenAI API key is required:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-private-key>

Prepared Prompts
----------------
You can preload prepared prompts to focus the AI:
- 'ai -p <prompt-name>: Load a prompt for the request.
- 'ai -lp': List the existing prompts
- 'ai -e': Create, edit, or delete the prepared prompts.
- 'ai -v': View the prompts and messages during a request.

There is a footer.md file that is appended to the end of
every prepared prompt. Review its contents.

File Review
-----------
The 'request_or_path' can be a path to a file such as a Python script.
To ask the AI to do something when you use a path, place a
comment at the top of the file such as:

# ChatGPT: Review this file and make suggestions for improvements.

Synchronous
-----------
By default the 'ai' script responds with content asynchronously
displaying the response in the terminal as it comes in.

If you wish you can change this behaviour by using 'ai -s'.

Note: If you use '-v' for verbose output, synchronous
calls will be forced.

Interactive
-----------
If you start an interactive session with 'ai -i', you can have
longer conversations about a topic. The input prompt supports
history over multiple runs and CTRL-R for searching history.

The history file is located at: '$HOME/.config/aihistory'

Hint: if you point to a file with the 'request_or_path' argument,
you can then discuss the file.
