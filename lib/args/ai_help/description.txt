Sends requests to ChatGPT using the OpenAI API.
The result is shown in the terminal and copied onto the clipboard.

An OpenAI API key is required:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-private-key>

Prepared Prompts
----------------
You can preload prepared prompts to focus the AI.
Prepared prompts are Markdown documents in the "prompts" directory.
If you wish to use the prepared prompts, they must be the first
command in the terminal after 'ai'.

To work with prepard prompts:

ai list prompts - To list the existing prompts.
ai edit - Create, edit, or delete the prepared prompts.
ai -v <prompt> <query> - View the prompts and messages used.
ai python - Load the python prompt for the request.
ai py - Load the python prompt if there is only one.
ai aws - Show a list of aws prompts to choose from.

There is a footer.md file that is appended to the end of
every prepared prompt. Review its contents.

File Review
-----------
The 'command' can be a path to a file such as a Python script.

At any time you can pass three commands such as:

ai <prepared-prompt> <file-path> <your-query>
ai <prepared-prompt> <your-query> <file-path>
ai <file-path> <your-query>
ai <your-query> <file-path>
ai <file-path>

The file contents will be loaded and sent as a user message
along with the query if provided.

Synchronous
-----------
By default the 'ai' script responds with content asynchronously
displaying the response in the terminal as it comes in.

If you wish you can change this behaviour by using 'ai -s'.

Note: If you use '-v' for verbose output, synchronous
calls will be forced.

Interactive
-----------
If you start an interactive session with 'ai -i', you can have
longer conversations about a topic. The input prompt supports
history over multiple runs and CTRL-R for searching history.

The history file is located at: '$HOME/.config/aihistory'

Hint: if you point to a file with the 'command' arguments,
you can then discuss the file.

Temperature
-----------
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2.
Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random,
while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused
and deterministic.

The default temperature is 0.

Try this:

ai -t 0 "Be creative, one short paragraph"
ai -t 1 "Be creative, one short paragraph"
ai -t 2 "Be creative, one short paragraph"
