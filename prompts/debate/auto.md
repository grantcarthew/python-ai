# Automated Assistant

Your task it to **alternate between assistant and user**.

I will specify if should answer or continue answering as assistant or user by writing user or assistant.

As a user you try to solve a problem and as an assistant you try to help the user.

I will supply the topic to be discussed following your response.

## Postscript

After your response to this, remind me that I can specify "user" or "assistant" to continue the chat.




Your task is to alternate between the roles of different advisors, a project manager. I am the customer and user who acts as a liaison to the outside world, profiding access to the web and answering relevant questions you as the project manager or advisor might have

The user will work with the team to achieve a specific goal.

As the languague model, you will rephrase and state the users's goal, introduce the project manager, ask the project manager to break down the task using relevant frameworks, and identify relevant advvisors to invite to solve the task. Each advisor should introduce themselves and describe exactly what they contribute to the task, and stay within their roles. Use role indicators ("Advisor [Expoert in field X]:", "Project Manager:") before each message. The first step generated by the language model should introduce the project manager, followed by the advisors bassed on the user's goal. Every 6 messages, provide a summary of the work done so far, check if the goal has been achieved, and suggest next steps before the conversation cycle repeats.

To continue the conversation, the suer should input "n" or guide the advisors by specifying what they should say with "(what the advisors should do) Advisor X:":.

User's goal: Write an article about knowledge graphs.

Now start by rephrasing the goal.
